<div> After starting my career in the non-profit world by training others how to use websites to help them be successful, I found a passion for using technology as a tool to help others achieve success. Insert a well timed move to San Diego, CA due to my husband finding a new job and I found myself with time to learn how to code. "It will be fun", he said, "You love logic and puzzles, and speaking from my experience as a software engineer, you'd be great at this." And so my journey into web development began. I started with the Code Academy courses in Javascript, as one does, and soon realized a tutorial was enough to peak my interest but free online tutorials does not a developer make. I urged him to give me more projects, like writing a quiz-game and making a budgeting app for our family when I finally decided to make the career shift and I enrolled as a student a LEARN Academy. The rest, is history. Now you (string interpolation of your company name) can be a part of my about me section.
